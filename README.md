## Project Description
ProtoLabHub is a platform designed to facilitate the monitoring and management of 3D printers within Protolab. The project aims to provide a smarter solution for checking the availability and progress of 3D printers. This has two primary goals: to make it easier for students to know when printers are available and to support staff with the maintenance of 3D printers and the procurement of filament. By leveraging peer-to-peer (P2P) and cloud computing technologies, ProtoLabHub offers a robust and scalable environment for IoT applications.
